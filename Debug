# Pulse setup

Make sure that the instance has enough space

The pulse repository requires the presence of three main applications on the path in order to build: CMAKE, Java,and Python

CMAKE: You have the option to download and install cmake from the website: this will also give you access to the cmake GUI (I haven't found the GUI to work very well with this) Besides you will need to manually set the path.
You can also install cmake using terminal commands: 'pip install cmake' should install cmake on the computer and it should be available on the path.

JAVA: The Pulse website recommends a download from Amazon. It is possible that you are already running Java on your computer, but it may not have all the requirements. I would still recommend using amazon coretto. You need jdk and not jre.
Ensure that the path is set. You will need to set the path permanently. Otherwise, everytime you restart the terminal you will be required to set the path. The following error is associated with the path not being set correctly.

PYTHON: As of August 2022, Pulse would not build correctly with Python 3.10. There are no apparent errors and the sourse code builds to completion but you will get a PyPulse.so file instead of the required PyPulse-cypthon-'pythonversion'-darwin.so. In python 3.9, this would be PyPulse-cypthon-'39'-darwin.so
Follow directions on the Pulse website to download the source code and build: [Pull and build]([https://gitlab.kitware.com/physiology/engine#building])

Ensure that python has all packages including numpy

Install compilers: I chose Debian/GNU: install gcc and g++ C/C++ compilers

After a successful build, 
Update pythonpath
Ensure ability to run HowTo examples: cd into the install/bin folder and run: python3 ~/Pulse/engine/src/python/howto/HoWTo_example

The next step involves setting up Pycharm. Download Pycharm from https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/. If you intend to use Google cloud Platform, make sure to download Pycharm Pro and activate an account.
