# ecmo_pulse_scripts

In order to generate graphs, you first need to run all the scripts to generate cvs files. Run `run_scripts/generate_cvs_files.py`
in order to accomplish this. You can then run `run_scripts/generate_graphs.py`. You must run these scripts in an environment set up with the Pulse bindings. It is suggested that you follow their guide for setup in PyCharm: https://gitlab.kitware.com/physiology/engine/-/wikis/Using-Pycharm.
